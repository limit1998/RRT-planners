# RRT-planners
This project contains RRT and RRT* planners for mobile robot path planning in 2D environments. The ```/workspace``` folder contains 8 static maps for simulation. The ```/lib``` folder contains following planner files written in MATLAB.

### planRRT & planRRTStar
This planner is based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) as described in LaValle et al. [[1]](#1) which is a incremental sampling-based algorithm for path planning in complex environments. It works by quickly exploring the state space to find new and feasible nodes and adding it to the search tree. The RRT* algorithm by Karaman et al. [[2]](#2) is a modification of RRT by the addition of two procedures - parent search to find appropriate low cost parent for the candidate node and rewire procedure to reattach an existing node to the candidate node.

### planPRRTStar
The potential function-based RRT* (P-RRT*) is based on paper by Qureshi et al. [[3]](#3) which used Artificial Potential Function (APF) as a sampling heuristic, to guide the sampling process towards the goal. This is carried out by placing an attractive potential on the goal location.

### planQRRTStar
Quick-RRT* (Q-RRT*) as described in Jeong et al. [[4]](#4) combines RRT* with an additonal search procedure that searches the ancestry of the selected parent node. This algorithms utilizes the triangle inequality property to come up with lesser cost paths in comparison to those generated by RRT*.
